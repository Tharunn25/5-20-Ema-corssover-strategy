## EMA and MACD Crossover Strategy

Strategy Overview
The strategy uses two input variables: the short EMA length and the long EMA length. These lengths determine the periods over which the EMAs are calculated. By default, the short EMA length is set to 5, and the long EMA length is set to 20. However, you can adjust these values according to your specific requirements.

The EMAs are calculated using the ta.ema() function in Pine Script, which takes the closing prices of the financial instrument as input. The short EMA represents a shorter-term moving average, while the long EMA represents a longer-term moving average.

Buy signals are generated when the short EMA crosses above the long EMA, indicating a potential upward trend. Conversely, sell signals are generated when the short EMA crosses below the long EMA, indicating a potential downward trend. The strategy uses the ta.crossover() and ta.crossunder() functions to identify these crossover points.
